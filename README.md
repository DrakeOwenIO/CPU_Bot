# CPU_Bot
Fun discord bot for my friends and I

v1.3.1 Changelog
-------------------------------------
Heres what changed! Version Number: v1.3.1 (The Insult Update!) Gather one! Gather all! For the Insult update! Have you ever wanted to insult your friends but dont exactly know what to say? Well have no fear because CPU_Bot has your back! Simply type +insult along with the name of your friend and CPU_Bot will do the work for you. You dont even have to take the blame for it because CPU_Bot will delete your message and take all the blame for you. If you want to see a list of all the insults type "+insult list". I also added a +gay command but you can figure out how that works. I also fixed the +remind bug where you had to enclose your words in quotes. You no longer have to do that.
